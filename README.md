# A/B Testing Case Study: Recommendation System (CallMeMaybe) 

**Professional Context**

- Program: TripleTen Data Analyst Bootcamp.

- Standards: This project was developed as a professional-grade simulation designed to meet the analytical requirements of high-scale, Fortune 500-level retail environments.

- Quality Assurance: The methodology, statistical logic, and Python code underwent rigorous expert peer review to ensure conclusions meet industry standards for data integrity.

**Executive Summary**

This project evaluates the impact of a new recommendation system on the conversion funnel of an international online store. By analyzing user behavior over a 14-day window, I conducted a statistical evaluation to determine if the system met the required 10% performance increase across all metrics. I concluded that while the system improved cart additions, it did not significantly increase final purchases, leading to a recommendation against a full rollout.

**Technical Stack**

- Language: Python 3.9.

- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels.

- Methodology: Z-test for Difference of Proportions, Funnel Conversion Analysis, Data Cleaning/Validation.

**Key Results**

- Data Integrity: Identified and removed 441 users incorrectly assigned to both groups to ensure test validity.

- Product Page: No statistically significant difference in initial views.

- Product Cart: Achieved a statistically significant increase (p < 0.01).

- Final Purchase: Difference was not significant; the system failed to drive more actual revenue.

**Language Note**

The technical documentation and code comments in the accompanying .ipynb file are written in Spanish, as the original project instructions and requirements were provided in that language.
